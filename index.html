                    <p>
                        During the weekend hackathon, our team developed and demoed a tool
                        <br>
                        that would help communities use open source and community data to help with improvements we called LivCity.
                        <br>
                        LivCity is an application that allows a city to gain community sourced information on selected areas.
                        <br>
                        This app functions by an administrator or researcher selecting an area to question, 
                        <br>
                        this could be for example regarding air pollution, traffic, safety, waste and more. 
                        <br>
                        Using feedback from the community, the appropriate authorities can develop needed infrastructure in
                        <br>
                        areas or appropriate social services, greatly improving the efficiency, usefulness, 
                        <br>
                        and bringing innovation to the community.

                    <p>
                        For GovHack 2019 the team created a tourism app designed to help connect visitors to local businesses
                        <br>
                        and help guide tourists to safe areas in the event of a civil emergency.
                        <br>
                        Localé is a tourism based application designed to better connect visitors to local businesses and events in a safe and stress free manner. 
                        <br>
                        Localé will also include local area safety and evacuation information to improve community safety. 
                        <br>
                        Data generated can be fed back to the council to aid in council and civil defense planning. 
                        <br>
                        The end goal of our idea is to have a well designed app with a great user experience, 
                        <br>
                        while accomplishing our core concepts well.
